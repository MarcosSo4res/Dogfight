<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28fff063-2dd3-4e31-94ed-54aadcea85c0" alt="screenshot" width="400"/>

**Dogfight** is a simple game built with **React Native** and **Expo** that lets players control an airplane using motion controls via the device’s **gyroscope**. This project serves as a showcase and educational demo of the `expo-sensors` library, specifically its `Gyroscope` module.

## 📱 Gameplay

Tilt your smartphone to steer the plane across the screen. The goal is to avoid obstacles or shoot down enemies (depending on your implementation) using intuitive motion controls!

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate how to:
- Use gyroscope data with `expo-sensors`
- Control game objects using device orientation
- Build interactive motion-based mobile experiences with Expo

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [expo-sensors](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sensors/)
- React Hooks and functional components

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- A smartphone with the **Expo Go** app installed (iOS or Android)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/motion-plane-game.git
   cd motion-plane-game
   
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install

3. **Start the project:**

   ```
   npx expo start

4. **Running on a Smartphone**

    Open the Expo Go app on your smartphone.

    Scan the QR code shown in your terminal or browser (after running npx expo start).

    The app will load on your phone and you'll be able to play immediately using motion controls.

    Note: Ensure your phone’s motion sensors (gyroscope) are enabled and working.
